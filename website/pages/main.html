The Sudolee is the brainchild of Alfred Sudoll and Fred Lee. In the mid-50's Alfred began construction of this unique sports car. He handcrafted the frame from tubular steel with a T-rail on the bottom edge and sculpted the body out of fiberglass. He chose an early fiftys Henry J Supersonic inline 6, transmission, rear and front suspension for the drive train. In [insert date], the New Jersey DMV inspected it and assigned a VIN as a "Sports Construction".
<br><br>
The car sat in an unfinished state until [insert date] when Fred Lee, a respected upholsterer and craftsman, brought the car to life. The frame, body, running boards, steering wheel, windshield, grill, clutch, brake pedal, gas pedal, all linkage, etc. was hand made specifically for this car. Some of the finishing touches include Harley Davidson head lights, tail lights, turn signals, front fenders, mirrors, rear bumpers, mud flaps, and gas cap. 
<br><br>
The ride has been described as a cross between a horse, a motorcycle, and a go-cart. It stops traffic where ever it goes. People really love the car. You would be hard pressed to find a more unique vehicle. 
<br><br>
This car is complete and ready for a new driver or museum. Browse the photos and contact Fred for more information.
